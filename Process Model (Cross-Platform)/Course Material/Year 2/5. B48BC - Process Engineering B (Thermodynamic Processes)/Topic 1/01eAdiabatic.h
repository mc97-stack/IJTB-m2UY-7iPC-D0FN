/* As detailed in "Adiabatic(void)", there are two methods that can be used to calculate the volume work for an adiabatic process involving an ideal gas. As such, the variable "method" was defined to dictate the behaviour of the data collection function. To review:
 - If method == 1, then the Pressure-Volume definition of volume work is used. The equation requires, the initial pressure and starting and end volume states to be known.
 - If method == 2, then the Pressure-Temperature method is used. The equation requires, the moles present in the system, starting temperature and starting and end pressures to be known.
 Across both methods, only the heat capacity ratio is required.
