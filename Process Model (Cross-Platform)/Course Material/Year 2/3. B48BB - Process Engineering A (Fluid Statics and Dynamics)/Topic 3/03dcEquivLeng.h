/// This subroutine is used to calculate head loss through the equivalent length method.
/// 
/// 1) The double array containing the data is declared with additional columns for the user inputs and calculation variables.
/// 
/// 2) The data required for calculation is inputted into column 0.
/// 
/// 3) The user is asked to input counts of each fitting into the program. Values are inputted into column 1.
/// 
/// 4) A for loop is run multiplying the counts by the equivalent length values. Values are outputted to column 2.
/// 
/// 5) Another for loop is run to determine the cumulative equivalent length.
/// 
/// 6) The user is asked whether they would like the data to be displayed in the console window. If affirmative, data is displayed.
