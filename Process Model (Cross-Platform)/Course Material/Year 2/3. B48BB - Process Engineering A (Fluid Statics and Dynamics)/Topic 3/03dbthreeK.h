/*  This subroutine is used to calculate the overall head loss incurred by a fluid travelling through large diameter pipes. An in-depth description of the function is described below:
 1) The array to contain the 3K database, input values and calculation steps is declared with 34 rows and 9 columns
 2) Data is entered into the array.
    Column 0 = k_1 values
    Column 1 = k_inf values
    Column 2 = k_d values (inches)
    Column 3 = k_d values (mm)
 3) The program asks for user input and inputs the collected integer values into Column 4
 4) The program collects the Reynolds number, Nominal Pipe Size and average fluid velocity
 5) The program begins calculating the head loss for each fitting before multiplying by the count.
    Column 5 = K-value by fitting
    Column 6 = Fitting head loss
    Column 7 = Total group head loss
    Column 8 = Cumulative head loss
 6) The program then asks if the user would like to see the final calculation sheet. If affirmative, a for loop is run to display the collected data on the console
 This subroutine does not return a value back to the calling function. In future versions, it may be the case that the total head loss is returned back to the calling function.
