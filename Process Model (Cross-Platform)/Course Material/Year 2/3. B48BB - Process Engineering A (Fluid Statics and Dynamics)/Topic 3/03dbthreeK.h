///1) The array to contain the 3K database, input values and calculation steps is declared with 34 rows and 9 columns.\n
///
///2) Data is entered into the array.
///   Column 0 = k_1 values
///   Column 1 = k_inf values
///   Column 2 = k_d values (inches)
///   Column 3 = k_d values (mm)
///
///3) The program asks for user input and inputs the collected integer values into Column 4.
///
///4) The program collects the Reynolds number, Nominal Pipe Size and average fluid velocity.
///
///5) The program begins calculating the head loss for each fitting before multiplying by the count.
///   Column 5 = K-value by fitting
///   Column 6 = Fitting head loss
///   Column 7 = Total group head loss
///   Column 8 = Cumulative head loss
///
///6) The program then asks if the user would like to see the final calculation sheet. If affirmative, a for loop is run to display the collected data on the console
