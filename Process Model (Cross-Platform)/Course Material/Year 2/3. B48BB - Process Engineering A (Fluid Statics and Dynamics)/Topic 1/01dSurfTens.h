 F = Force to break the fluid surface (N)

- After collection, the value is converted to metres before being utilised to calculate the circumference of the ring (L).

 This subroutine returns the values stated above in the declaration to the main function in this file ("SurfTens"). This subroutine has a codependency on the subroutine "wettfacts" to provide information on the fluid properties after the contact angle with the ring has been inputted.
